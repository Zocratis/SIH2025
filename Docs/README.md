# Fake Certificate Detection & Authentication Platform

## üèÜ Problem Statement
With increasing digitization, the problem of fake degrees and forged academic certificates has become a major concern for higher education institutions, employers, and government bodies. Verification today is often manual and inconsistent, leading to corruption and misuse.

Our solution aims to create a **smart, secure, and scalable digital platform** for detecting and authenticating academic certificates across Jharkhand.

## üéØ Objectives
- Detect and prevent the use of **fake or tampered degrees/certificates**.
- Support **both legacy (scanned)** and **new (ERP-issued)** certificates.
- Enable **employers, universities, and government departments** to easily verify certificates.
- Provide an **admin dashboard** for forgery monitoring and blacklisting offenders.
- Future-proof the system with **blockchain integration**.

## üîë Key Features
1. **Employer Verification Portal**
   - Upload a certificate (PDF/JPEG).
   - OCR extraction + database + blockchain hash verification.
   - Confidence score and explainable reasons for results.

2. **Institution Integration Module**
   - Universities/colleges can bulk-upload records (CSV) or real-time upload via ERP.
   - Certificates are hashed (SHA-256) and optionally anchored on blockchain.

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Monitor verification activity.
   - Detect forgery trends with graph-based analysis.
   - Manage blacklisted institutions or offenders.

4. **AI-powered Detection**
   - OCR + NLP validation for course/institution names.
   - Siamese CNN for signature/seal matching.
   - Autoencoder/One-Class SVM for anomaly detection in legacy scanned certificates.

5. **Blockchain Simulation**
   - Prevents fake entries in the future by hashing new certificates.
   - Prototype uses simulated blockchain; future scope includes Polygon/Hyperledger.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](architecture-diagram.png)

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express + Sequelize + PostgreSQL)
- **OCR Service**: FastAPI + Tesseract
- **ML Service**: FastAPI + PyTorch/Scikit-learn
- **Blockchain (Sim)**: SHA-256 Hashing + mock txHash

## ‚ö° Workflow
1. Employer uploads certificate.
2. OCR extracts key details (Name, Roll No, Course, Marks, Cert ID).
3. Backend matches against institutional records.
4. Blockchain registry verifies hash (for ERP-issued certs).
5. ML models check signatures, seals, anomalies.
6. Result returned with **confidence score + explainable reasons**.
7. Logs stored in DB; suspicious cases flagged for admin review.

## üìä Differentiators
Unlike plain OCR + CNN solutions, our project adds:
- Blockchain-backed prevention (not just detection).
- Graph-based forgery pattern analysis (network-level detection).
- NLP validation of institution/course names.
- Explainable AI (results show reasons, not just ‚Äúfake/genuine‚Äù).
- Privacy-preserving design (hash-based verification).

---

## üöÄ Future Scope
- Full blockchain deployment (Polygon/Hyperledger).
- Direct integration with **DigiLocker APIs**.
- Advanced anomaly detection using Vision Transformers.
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving verification.
- Nationwide rollout for **all Indian universities**.
